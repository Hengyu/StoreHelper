//  Notes on intermittent UserDefaults error. From time to time you may see the following error:
//
//      [User Defaults] Couldn't read values in CFPrefsPlistSource<0x600003da5000>
//      (Domain: group.com.{developer}.{app}, User: kCFPreferencesAnyUser, ByHost: Yes, Container: (null), Contents Need Refresh: Yes):
//      Using kCFPreferencesAnyUser with a container is only allowed for System Containers, detaching from cfprefsd
//
//  It implies that attempts to read/write from the shared AppGroup UserDefaults suite have failed, when they actually haven't.
//  According to the Apple engineer who works/worked on this it is a spurious warning message and can be ignored.
